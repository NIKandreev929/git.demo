All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
And it went by, like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay

Yeah, I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
Sing it with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Dream On Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer

The past is gone
t went by like dusk to dawn
sn't that the way
verybody's got their dues in life to pay
